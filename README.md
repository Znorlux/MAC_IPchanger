# MAC_IPchanger

With this simple script written in bash we can change our local IP address and our MAC address with the help of the "macchanger" tool.
It generates a random IP and a random MAC address that will constantly change at a random interval of 10 minutes. In this way there was a more natural change of directions and a pattern of constant change could not be traced.

You need to give it root permissions with chmod +x
